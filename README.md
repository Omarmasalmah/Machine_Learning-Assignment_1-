# Car Dataset Analysis and Linear Regression
This project involves the analysis of a car dataset using Python and Pandas, focusing on exploring, cleaning, and modeling the data. The dataset contains information about various car features, including fuel economy (mpg), horsepower, acceleration, and more.
# Tasks
 ## 1. Dataset Overview:

Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Examine the number of features and examples in the dataset.

 ## 2. Missing Values:

Identify features with missing values.
Determine the number of missing values for each feature.
Implement imputation methods (e.g., mean, median, or mode) to fill missing values.
 
## 3. Fuel Economy Analysis:

Use a box plot to compare fuel economy (mpg) for different countries.

## 4. Distribution Analysis:

Determine which feature ('acceleration', 'horsepower', or 'mpg') has a distribution most similar to a Gaussian.
Visualize histograms for each feature.

## 5. Correlation Analysis:

Create a scatter plot of 'horsepower' vs. 'mpg' to explore correlation.
Implement simple linear regression using the closed-form solution.
Visualize the learned regression line.

## 6. Advanced Regression:

Implement quadratic regression using a quadratic function.
Repeat simple linear regression using the gradient descent algorithm.
